# Vocabulary for Web Publications Manifest

This is the repository for the Web Publication Manifest vocabulary and JSON-LD context files. It is adjunct to the work on Web Publications, developed by the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/).

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informativeâ€”by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.

## Final locations of the documents

These files are _not_ aimed to be part of a W3C Technical Report. Instead, the `wp.*` and `wp-context.*` files are meant to be copied to the `https://www.w3.org/ns/` directory (which can only be done by a W3C staff member).
